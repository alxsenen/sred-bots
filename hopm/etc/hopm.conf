 * The long explanation:
 *
 * Scanner defines a virtual scanner. For each user being scanned, a scanner
 * will use a file descriptor (and subsequent connection) for each protocol.
 * Once connecting it will negotiate the proxy to connect to
 * target_ip:target_port (target_ip MUST be an IP address).
 *
 * Once connected, any data passed through the proxy will be checked to see if
 * target_string is contained within that data. If it is the proxy is
 * considered open. If the connection is closed at any point before
 * target_string is matched, or if at least max_read bytes are read from the
 * connection, the negotiation is considered failed.
